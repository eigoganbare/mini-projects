<p>The National Coordinator (NC) keeps JCF running by communicating with the other leaders and helping 
    Christians get connected with other Christians. The NC is the official representative for JCF to 
    the Association of JET (AJET), and also manages the JCF website.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Jovald. I’m from Cape Town in South Africa and have been on the JET programme 
    since 2017. In my first year, JCF helped to find a church in my area and a couple years later I 
    met the leadership team at the JCF autumn retreat in Nagano. My involvement in leadership began 
    in 2020 as a bible study group leader, which I’m still leading (Tuesday nights on Zoom). Since the 
    covid-19 pandemic started we haven’t been able to meet in-person much, but I’m grateful that God 
    gave us the people who created video-calling. May the Spirit of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ 
    be with you all. Amen</p>

    <p>I’m from Tennessee in the United States. I started my time off on the JET Program in Shiga 
        Prefecture, but am now working as a direct hire ALT in Nagano Prefecture. I have been involved 
        in this wonderful JCF community since my first retreat in fall 2011, and honestly, I never 
        imagined I would be around this long. All praise and glory goes to God for His plans for my 
        life here. It has been an absolute joy to see how He is working and moving in Japan.</p>

<p>I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and have lived in various places in the American 
    south-east before moving to Fukui Prefecture in 2014. Now, I am happily married to a 
    wonderful Christian man who loves me and supports me. I am the daughter of a Baptist 
    preacher and an elementary school teacher who always raised me to follow Christ. Shortly 
    after graduating from university, I began feeling that God was calling me to come to Japan. 
    Now that I’m here, I will seek to follow God’s direction for my life and carry out 
    whatever mission He has in store for me. My hobbies are watching movies, knitting, 
    cooking, and reading.</p>

    <p>I was born in a non-Christian Japanese family. My home town is Nagoya, and now live in 
        Fukui prefecture. I shouldn’t write down my whole salvation testimony here, but through 
        my friends who are JCF members, I joined retreat and met with lots of beautiful JCF family. 
        That was happen before I got baptized. God has amazing good plans. Now I’m following Jesus, 
        and would love to lay back against Him.</p>
