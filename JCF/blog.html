<h1>JCF Community Survey</h1>

<p>After much prayer and discussion, the JCF leadership team has decided to re-evaluate the 
    types of events and opportunities for engagement JCF offers in order to better serve the 
    Christian community in Japan. In order to do so, we ask that you complete this survey, 
    which should take no more than 10 minutes. This is available to all members, past and current, 
    whether still in Japan or living abroad.</p>

    <p>
    We are hoping that the thoughtful feedback you provide will help guide our decisions to create 
    a more cohesive, active Christian community here. Additionally, if you would like to volunteer 
    in any capacity or make a monetary donation, we ask that you leave your email address so the 
    leadership team can get in touch with you.</p>
    
    <p>
    If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the National Coordinator at 
    jcfnatco@gmail.com</p>
    
    <p>
    Thank you for serving with us.</p>
    
    <p>
    God bless,</p>
    
    <p>

    <h1>Spending Time with God</h1>

    <p>It’s hard to believe, but we’re about to wrap up 5 months of 2021. 
        As spring gradually shifts to summer, let’s take time step back from the busyness and 
        check-in with God. I hope this reflection from former national coordinator, Royal Langer, 
        can help encourage you to take time to slow down and notice God at work in your life. 
        The following is a post taken from the JCF blog archives. It was originally posted 
        by HACHIMENREIROU on February 12, 2014.</p>
    <hr class="hr-blog">
    <p>In the midst of the colder weather, we can easily forget how blessed we are by God. 
        God has chosen to give us breath in our lungs, food to eat, money to buy it with, 
        employment and relationships with other people. We can not only forget to count our 
        blessings (God didn’t give us enough appendages to count them!), but we can also 
        forget to ask for more. As children of God, we have the blessings of heaven at our 
        disposal. We can also pray these blessings into other people’s lives as well. God is 
        our Father, and like a good Father, He wants to give us good things. He just wants to 
        hear us ask for them.</p>

    <p>Let’s challenge God to bless us and others in specific ways this week.</p>

    <blockquote>I am a God who heals. I heal broken bodies, broken minds, broken hearts, 
        broken lives, and broken relationships. My very presence has immense healing powers. 
        You cannot live close to Me without experiencing some degree of healing. However, it 
        is also true that you have not because you ask not. You receive the healing that flows 
        naturally from My presence, whether you seek it or not. But there is more–much more–available 
        to those who ask. – Jesus Calling</blockquote>

    <p>If you want to dwell more in the presence of God, read the entire chapter of the following verses:</p>

    <ul><li class="li-blog">Psalm 103:3</li>
    <li class="li-blog">James 4:2</li>
    <li class="li-blog">Matthew 7:7-8</li>
